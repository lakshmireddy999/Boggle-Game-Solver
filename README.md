# Boggle-Game-Solver
This is a Java code for implementation and solving of Boggle game using File handling &amp; Data Structures and Algorithms with java
I have implemented this project by using a dictionary.txt file to check whether the words formed are valid or not.this file also available in the folder
I have stored all words from the dictionary.txt file to trie datastructure through filehandling.
Implemented the functions like findwords using backtracking to get valid words from the randomly generated boggle board and store the words in the hashset
At last each word gets one point.
If you can get more words correct you get more points.
